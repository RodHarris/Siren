jmake script options:

Usage: ./jmake [mode] [optional-args]

where modes include:

compile
	This will compile the source code and create the executable jar file
	Siren/bin/siren.jar

	Files in Siren/resource will be included in the jar
	Files in Siren/copyrights will be included in the jar

	Any dependencies must be in the CLASSPATH, or in the
	Siren/lib/dependencies.txt file.
	These dependencies must be found dynamically at compile and run time.

	[optional-args] are passed to the javac process


doc
	run javadoc over src code and place generated html into Siren/javadoc

	[optional-args] are passed to the javadoc process


clean
	removes Siren/javadoc/* [generated documentation]
	removes Siren/lib/class/* [compiled class files]
	removes Siren/bin/siren.jar [executable jar file]

	[optional-args] are ignored


release
	make a release snapshot of your project

	requires the 'compiled' jar file
	jtag must also be in the path

	creates a directory release/build-[#]/
	creates a directory release/build-[#]/Siren

	copies bin/siren.jar to release/build-[#]/Siren/
	zips this up in release/build-[#]/Siren-bin.zip

	javadocs the source and jars it up in release/build-[#]/Siren-javadoc.jar
	
	cleans the project then tars it up as release/build-[#]/Siren-src.tar.gz


branch

	jtag must be in the path

	allows you to branch your source code
	makes a copy of src and resource in branch/src-[#]


**) the compiling stage tries to tag the source code - if you don't have the
jtag executable it may complain, but it will still build the code, but the
siren.LibSiren.BUILD variable won't be incremented and 
siren.LibSiren.BUILD_TIME won'tbe updated
